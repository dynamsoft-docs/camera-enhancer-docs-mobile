## ifSkipCameraInspection

Returns or sets whether to skip camera inspection at initialization to save time. Note that if a previously used camera is already available in the [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage), the inspection is skipped automatically. Read more on [ifSaveLastUsedCamera](#ifsavelastusedcamera).

```typescript
ifSkipCameraInspection: boolean;
```

## ifSaveLastUsedCamera

Returns or sets whether to save the last used camera and resolution. This feature makes use of the [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) of the browser.

> NOTE
>
> This feature only works on mainstream browsers like Chrome, Firefox and Safari. Other browsers may change the device IDs dynamically thus making it impossible to track the camera.

```typescript
ifSaveLastUsedCamera: boolean;
```

## getAllCameras

Returns infomation of all available cameras on the device.

```typescript
getAllCameras(): Promise<VideoDeviceInfo[]>;
```

**Parameters**

None.

**Return value**

A promise resolving to an array of `VideoDeviceInfo` objects.

**Code Snippet**

```js
let cameras = await enhancer.getAllCameras();
if (cameras.length) {
    await enhancer.selectCamera(cameras[0]);
}
```

**See also**

* [VideoDeviceInfo](interface/videodeviceinfo.md)

## selectCamera

Chooses a camera as the video source.

> If called before `open()` or `show()` , the selected camera will be used. Otherwise, the system will decide which one to use.

```typescript
selectCamera(cameraObjectOrDeviceID: VideoDeviceInfo | string): Promise<PlayCallbackInfo>;
```

**Parameters**

`cameraObjectOrDeviceID` : specifies the camera.

**Return value**

A promise resolving to a `PlayCallbackInfo` object.

**Code Snippet**

```js
let cameras = await enhancer.getAllCameras();
if (cameras.length) {
    await enhancer.selectCamera(cameras[0]);
}
```

**See also**

* [PlayCallbackInfo](interface/playcallbackinfo.md)

## getSelectedCamera

Returns information about the selected / current camera.

```typescript
getSelectedCamera(): VideoDeviceInfo;
```

**Parameters**

None.

**Return value**

A `VideoDeviceInfo` object with details about the selected camera.

**Code Snippet**

```js
let camera = enhancer.getSelectedCamera();
console.log(camera.label);
```

**See also**

* [VideoDeviceInfo](interface/videodeviceinfo.md)

## open

Turns on the camera to start streaming live video.

```typescript
open(appendOrShowUI?: boolean): Promise<PlayCallbackInfo>;
```

**Parameters**

`appendOrShowUI` : this parameter specifies how to handle the UI. When set to true, if the UI doesn't exist in the DOM tree, the CameraEnhancer instance will append it in the DOM and show it; if the UI already exists in the DOM tree but is hidden, it'll be displayed. When not set or set to false, it means not to change the original state of that UI: if it doesn't exist in the DOM tree, nothing shows up on the page; if it exists in the DOM tree, it may or may not show up depending on its original state.

> NOTE: if `setUIElement()` is not called before `open()` , the default UI Element will be used, which is equivalent to the following code:
>
> ```js
> await cameraEnhancer.setUIElement(Dynamsoft.DCE.CameraEnhancer.defaultUIElementURL); 
> await cameraEnhancer.open(appendOrShowUI); 
> ```
>
> If you want to use a different UI element, call API [ `setUIElement()` ](initialization.md#setuielement) beforehand.

**Return value**

A promise resolving to a `PlayCallbackInfo` object.

**See also**

* [PlayCallbackInfo](interface/playcallbackinfo.md)

## close

Stops video streaming and releases the camera.

```typescript
close(hideUI?: boolean): void;
```

**Parameters**

`hideUI` : this parameter specifies how to handle the UI. When set to true, if the UI doesn't exist in the DOM tree or it exists but is hidden, nothing is done; if the UI already exists in the DOM tree and is shown, it'll be hidden. When not set or set to false, it means not to change the original state of that UI: if it doesn't exist in the DOM tree, nothing happens; if it exists in the DOM tree, it may or may not be hidden depending on its original state.

**Return value**

None.

## turnOnTorch

Turns on the torch/flashlight if the current camera supports it.

> This method should be called when the camera is turned on. Note that it only works with Chromium-based browsers such as Edge and Chrome on Windows or Android. Other browsers such as Firefox or Safari are not supported. Note that all browsers on iOS (including Chrome) use WebKit as the rendering engine and are not supported.

```typescript
turnOnTorch(): Promise<void>;

## getZoomSettings

Returns the zoom settings.

**Code Snippet**

```js
console.log(enhancer.getZoomSettings().factor);
```

## setZoom

Zooms the video.

> How it works:
>
> 1. If the camera supports zooming and the zoom factor is within its supported range, zooming is done directly by the camera.
> 2. If the camera does not support zooming, WebGL is used instead.
> 3. If the camera supports zooming but the zoom factor is beyond what it supports, the camera's maximum zoom is used, and WebGL is used to do the rest. (In this case, you may see a brief video flicker between the two zooming processes).

```typescript
setZoom(settings:{factor: number}): Promise<void>;
```

**Parameters**

`settings` : specifies how to zoom the video. As of version 3.2, the setting only contains a zoom factor.

**Return value**

A promise that resolves when the operation succeeds.

**Code Snippet**

```js
await enhancer.setZoom({
    factor: 3
});
```

**See also**

* [getCapabilities](#getcapabilities)

## resetZoom

Resets the zoom level of the video.

```typescript
resetZoom(): Promise<void>;
```

**Parameters**

None.

**Return value**

A promise that resolves when the operation succeeds.

    height: string;
};

    distance: number;
    area: FocusArea;
};
getFocusSettings(): FocusSettings;
```

**Parameters**

None.

**Return value**

The current focus settings.

**Code Snippet**

```js
enhancer.getFocusSettings();
```

**See also**

* [getCapabilities](#getcapabilities)

## setFocus

Sets how the camera focuses.

> NOTE:
>
> 1. This method should be called when the camera is turned on. Note that it only works with Chromium-based browsers such as Edge and Chrome on Windows or Android. Other browsers such as Firefox or Safari are not supported. Note that all browsers on iOS (including Chrome) use WebKit as the rendering engine and are not supported.
> 2. Typically, `continuous` mode works best. `manual` mode based on a specific area helps the camera focus on that particular area which may seem blurry under `continuous` mode. `manual` mode with specified distances is for those rare cases where the camera distance must be fine-tuned to get the best results.

```typescript
setFocus(settings: { mode: string } | { mode: 'manual', distance: number } | {
    mode: 'manual', area: {
        centerPoint: { x: string, y: string };
        // If not specified, the width is 1/6 of the video width or height, whichever is narrower
        width?: string;
        // If not specified, the height is 1/6 of the video width or height, whichever is narrower
        height?: string;
    }
}) => Promise<void>;
```

**Parameters**

`settings` : specifies the focus settings. Available `mode` options are `continuous` and `manual` . `distance` and `area` are only effective when `mode` is set to `manual` and they should not coexist. The combinations are shown in the code snippet.

**Return value**

A promise that resolves when the operation succeeds.

**Code Snippet**

> The "continuous" mode invokes the camera to focus automatically and continuously. Use [getCapabilities()](#getcapabilities) to inspect whether the camera supports "continuous" mode.

```js
if (enhancer.getCapabilities().focusMode.find(mode => mode.localeCompare('continuous') == 0)) {
    await enhancer.setFocus({
        mode: "continuous"
    });
}
```

> The "manual" mode means manually specifying the focus distance.
> Use [getCapabilities()](#getcapabilities) to inspect the distance range.
>
> ```js
> enhancer.getCapabilities().focusDistance; > //{max: 1024, min: 0, step: 10}
> ```
>
> NOTE: If the set distance is between two allowed values, it will be rounded to the nearest value.

```js
await enhancer.setFocus({
    mode: "manual",
    distance: 200
});
```

> The SDK also has a built-in algorithm that adjusts focus distance based on the blurriness of a particular area. Specify the area with the parameter `area` .
>
> NOTE: the area is a rectangle defined by its center point and its width and height. All coordinates can be in pixels or percentages, such as "500px" or "50%". Percentages are based on stream dimensions.

```js
await enhancer.setFocus({
    mode: "manual",
    area: {
        centerPoint: {
            x: "50%",
            y: "50%"
        },
        width: "50%",
        height: "50%"
    }
});
