## Advanced Features Details

### Frame Filter

### Sensor Control

The mobile sensor can help on filtering out all the frames that are produced when the device is shaking. It will get better effects when enabled together with **Frame Filter**.

### Enhanced Focus

This feature can assist the camera in its focus. It is recommended to be enabled on low-end devices.

### Fast Mode

The video frames are cropped into small sizes when the **Fast Mode** is enabled. The feature will sharply improve the processing efficiency When the targeting areas are always located in the middle of the video. The average time consumption on cropping each frame is less than 10ms.

### Auto Zoom

**Auto Zoom** feature is specially designed for decoding barcodes from long distances. The camera will zoom in automatically to enlarge the region of interest when a barcode is detected far away. The **Auto Zoom** feature might not work ideally when processing the documents or the text areas. Please disable this feature if the targets are not barcodes.

### Smart Torch

Otherwise, the torch button is hidden. The feature doesn't control the status of the mobile torch. Users have to click on the torch button to turn on the torch.
