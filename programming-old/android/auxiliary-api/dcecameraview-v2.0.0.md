## DCECameraView

Initialize the `DCECameraView` object.

```java
DCECameraView(android.content.Context context)
```

**Parameters**

`context`: An instance to global information about an application environment. 

&nbsp;

## setOverlayVisible

This method controls whether the camera view displays coloured and translucent overlay.

```java
void setOverlayVisible(boolean overlayVisibile)
```

**Parameters**

`overlayVisibile`: If true, the camera view will draw and display overlay according to the position and colour settings. Otherwise, the overlay will be hidden.

**Code Snippet**

```java
//Suppose dceCameraView is an object of `DCECameraView`
dceCameraView.setOverlayVisible(true);
```

&nbsp;

## getOverlayVisible

Get the visibility (true: visible/ false: invisible) of the overlay.

```java
boolean getOverlayVisible()
```

**Return Value**

The visibility (true: visible/ false: invisible) of the overlay.

**Code Snippet**

```java
//Suppose dceCameraView is an object of `DCECameraView`
boolean isVisible = dceCameraView.getOverlayVisible();
```

&nbsp;


## setOverlayColour

Set the stroke and fill colour of the overlay.

```java
void setOverlayColour(int strokeARGB, int fillARGB)
```

**Parameters**

`strokeARGB`: The colour code of the overlay stroke.
`fillARGB`: The colour code of the overlay stroke.

**Code Snippet**

```java
//Suppose dceCameraView is an object of `DCECameraView`
dceCameraView.setOverlayColour(0xff00ff00, 0x00000000);
```

&nbsp;

## setViewfinderVisible

This method controls whether to display a viewfinder.

```java
void setViewfinderVisible(boolean viewfinderVisible)
```

**Parameters**

`viewfinderVisible`: A boolean value that means whether the viewfinder is visible or not. Users can define the position and size of the viewfinder via method [`setViewfinder`](#setviewfinder). The viewfinder will be created based on the default value if the `setViewfinder` has never been triggered.

**Code Snippet**

```java
//Suppose dceCameraView is an object of `DCECameraView`
dceCameraView.setViewfinderVisible(true);
```

&nbsp;

## getViewfinderVisible

Get the visibility (true: visible/ false: invisible) of the viewfinder.

**Return Value**

A boolean value that means whether the viewfinder is visible.

**Code Snippet**

```java
//Suppose dceCameraView is an object of `DCECameraView`
boolean flag = dceCameraView.getViewfinderVisible();
```

&nbsp;

## setViewfinder

Set the position and the size of the viewfinder.

```java
void setViewfinder(float left, float top, float right, float bottom) throws CameraEnhancerException
```

**Parameters**

`left`: The distance (by percentage) between the left border of the viewfinder and the left side of the screen. The default value is 0.15.  
`top`: The distance (by percentage) between the top border of the viewfinder and the top side of the screen. The default value is 0.3.  
`right`: The distance (by percentage) between the right border of the viewfinder and the left side of the screen. The default value is 0.85.  
`bottom`: The distance (by percentage) between the bottom border of the viewfinder and the top side of the screen. The default value is 0.7.

**Code Snippet**

```java
//Suppose dceCameraView is an object of `DCECameraView`
dceCameraView.setViewfinder(0.2, 0.3, 0.8, 0.7);
```

**Remarks**

The viewfinder is built based on the screen coordinate system. The origin of the coordinate is the left-top point of the mobile device. The `left border` of the viewfinder always means the closest border that parallels to the left side of the mobile device no matter how the mobile device is rotated.
